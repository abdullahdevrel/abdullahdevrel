## Supporting Open Source Projects

I actively reach out to open-source projects and developers, pitching our free API and database services. We are 100% committed to supporting open-source projects and indie developers. To give back to them, we offer a host of free services ([free API](https://ipinfo.io/signup), [free data downloads](https://ipinfo.io/products/free-ip-database) and [platform integrations](https://ipinfo.io/integrations)) that come with full accuracy and zero compromise. Within only a year of releasing our free database, we have earned the trust of some major Open-Source Projects. Through hundreds of thousands of developers' code, millions of machines call our API service.

## Help us improve our data

We generate our internet data through active measurement on the **entire** internet. We do this internet measurement through a research network of hundreds of servers called [_ProbeNet_](https://ipinfo.io/blog/probe-network-how-we-make-sure-our-data-is-accurate/). We are approaching a thousand servers and are eager to find servers in exotic locations, IPv6 enabled and with interesting network characteristics.

Feel free to support this endeavor by recommending a hosting provider to us using this form.

## Tell me your IPinfo story

Surprisingly, even though I am literally the "developer relations" guy at IPinfo, I do not always know how users use our data. Sometimes I come across stories of how users use our data that make me really surprised! I really appreciate hearing about these stories. If you would like, you can drop a post in our [community](https://community.ipinfo.io/) sharing how you or your company use our data, or you can share them anonymously with this Google form.

I enjoy talking with developers, both new and experienced. I always have my terminal and IDE ready to write quick scripts and can share IP data results via GitHub gists.

Also, I strongly believe that figuring out how to use our service is the last thing you should be concerned about. Using IPinfo involves pretty much some boilerplate code, so if you struggle even a little bit, reach out to me as soon as possible and I will walk you through using IPinfo.
